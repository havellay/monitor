common
  - make a plot tool to overlay the prices and indicator
  - make some experiments to see effectivness of this thing
  - design a web-page for the data entry thing
  - add more indicators
  - figure out how to add pre-requisites

Focus on End of Day prices
  - send an email with the report that we have
      can send emails only with a mail server that allows us to;
      find a web host first

Focus on Intra day prices
  - rework the existing end of day model
  - have an invocation flag to look at
  - add a few etc methods to Symbol that get called based on
    this invocation flag

design a deamon or something to constantly generate reports for
a few users

be able to look at past data with current indicator and determine
strength of a trigger. once that is done, try to train a ML algo

Think about storing prices and dates in two separate lists instead
of a list of two element tuples

decouple Report.py - make it easier for user to execute for a
given set of companies
